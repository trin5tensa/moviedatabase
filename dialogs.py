@dataclass
class Dialog:
    """This class provides the core functionality for a modal dialog.

    It offers two vertically arranged frames which are seen by the user. The lower is the
    buttonbox and this contains the buttons defined by the caller. The upper is
    the body frame which is undefined in this base class. Subclasses are required and should
    define the content of the body frame as a minimum.

    If called the class will return the button clicked by the user.

    Size
    ----
    The size of the dialog window is fixed and will be made large enough to display all of the
    widgets which it contains. A convenience method,
    'make_resizable', is available for subclasses. See its documentation for details.

    Placement
    ---------
    The dialog is centered on the parent window. If this causes the dialog to either be
    off screen at the top or off screen at the left it will be moved down or to the right
    respectively. Note thia assumes the dialog window will fit on the screen. If a subclass
    creates a window that is too large then that subclass is responsible for handling the
    excess,

    Internal Frames
    ---------------
    The method 'create_widgets' creates a body frame and a buttonbox frame placed vertically
    beneath it. Override create_widgets to create other configurations.

    Focus
    -----
    Set initial focus to a widget by returning an optional focus widget from the body method.
    If the  body method returns None then return an optional focus widget from the buttonbox
    method.
    If neither method returns a focus widget the dialog will take focus for itself. If both
    methods return widgets the body widget will get focus.

    Body
    ----
    Override the body method to create content for the body of the dialog. This can be as
    simple as a line of text for a simple alert dialog or a complex hierarchy of widgets.

    Buttonbox and Buttons
    ---------------------
    The caller can determine the number of buttons and their internal names. Each button
    must have labels which are the text seen by the user.

        Cancel Button and Other Cancel Actions
        --------------------------------------
        The rightmost button will close the dialog without taking any further action. The
        rightmost button will be returned to the user if the user cancels by either clicking
        the rightmost button, pressing the <Escape> key, or clicking the window's close button.
        The rightmost button will get focus unless an overriding subclass sets focus to a widget in
        the dialog body.

        Other buttons
        -------------
        All other buttons will call the substantive method. This calls the methods validate
        and keep_alive. Subclasses may override these methods if they wish to:
            Implement a validation method or
            Carry out button action processing including conditionally closing the window
            depending on which button is clicked.

        Button enabled/disabled status
        -------------------------------
        The caller does not have access to change the enabled state of buttons.

        If changes to the enabled state are desired before the dialog is closed and control is
        returned to the caller this class will need to be subclassed. The subclass will
        have to intercept events and switch the buttons' enabled status.


    The module is based on Fredrik Lundh's "An Introduction to Tkinter" November 2005.
    (http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-dialog-windows.htm) For testability, however, the
    tk classes are not a superclass of Dialog but are implemented as attributes.
