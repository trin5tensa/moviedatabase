    File format
    The first record will be a header row which must contain the column names 'title' and 'year'.
    It may contain column names 'minutes', 'director', and 'notes'.
    Subsequent records must match the first row in number  of items and their position in the row.

    Validation
    The entire file will be rejected if there are any invalid names in the first row.
    Individual records will be rejected if they are the wrong length.
    They will also be rejected if they violate database integrity rules.

    Output FIle
